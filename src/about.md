### The Web

I created my first website (in MS FrontPage!) in middle school, before I even had access to the Internet at my house. I vividly remember writing `<img>` in my HTML for the first time and looking in awe as an image appeared in the browser. I thought it was totally awesome. 20 years later, I still think so.

My core skills are in semantic HTML & CSS, vanilla JS and WordPress theme development but I'm constantly expanding my knowledge, keeping up with latest and greatest trends in web dev. Lately, I've been loving exploring the JAMstack – from static site generators to serverless functions, I find it endlessly fascinating.

Other web-related topics I'm interested in include web performance, accesibility, ethics and privacy. I'm hoping to level up my JavaScript knowledge and try out Vue in the near future. I truly love learning and facing new challenges every day.

### WordPress

I've been using WordPress since before we had post thumbnails and have been a freelance developer for over 10 years now. I specialize in building custom WordPress websites for a variety of clients – from small businesses and non-profits to large e-commerce sites.

I enjoy working with creative agencies and designers who need someone to bring their ideas to life, and pride myself in clean, semantic, maintainable code. All of my custom work strictly follows the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/), uses functions, filters and actions to ensure the project is stable, secure and future-proof.

### Offline

I don't think I'm ever truly offline, but when I'm not writing code, I can be found spending time with my partner in crime – my westie – [Milton](https://instagram.com/miltonthewestie/), traveling, playing video games or generally being a geek. Here's what I'm doing [now](/now/).

### About this website

Due to my recent obsession with everything JAMstack, I decided to build this site using the wonderful [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and host it on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) – it was a fantastic experience! It's forever a work in progress – I'm constantly tweaking, refactoring code (you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/hellojusi/jusi.codes)) and adding new stuff, so stay tuned.
